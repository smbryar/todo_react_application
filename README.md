# My Tasks App

This is the front-end of My Tasks App, built while completing the [Tech Returners](https://www.techreturners.com/) Your Journey Into Tech course. 
It integrates with a back-end, available [here](https://github.com/smbryar/todo-application-backend).
You can access the app online [here](https://smbryar.github.io/todo_react_application/).

## Features

My Tasks App is a web-app to track personal tasks with the added functionality of tasks having the option to repeat after being completed. 
This is particularly useful for tracking regular chores.

The login experience has been built using AWS Cognito.

There is a second screen with a calendar display where tasks can be seen with their start and due dates. 
This is useful for long-term planning and identifying crunch points.

There is a third screen with a daily task planner.
This is useful for short-term planning.

## Future Work

Future functionality ideas include:
- a weekly planner where tasks can be assigned time-slots

## Technology Used

This project uses the following technology:

- ReactJS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- AWS Cognito

- Bootstrap
- Axios
- ESLint

It has been designed and built with mobile-first responsive principles.
