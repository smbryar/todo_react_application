# My Tasks App

My Tasks App is a web-app to track personal tasks with the added functionality of tasks having the option to repeat after being completed. 
This is particularly useful for tracking regular chores.

## Future Work

Future functionality ideas include:
- improved screen reader accessibility, particularly on Add Task form
- a calendar component where all tasks can be seen and their start and due dates
- a weekly planner where tasks can be assigned time-slots

## React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
